                            <p>Although messages are securely sent and received through the Service, it is in all cases and always the user’s responsibility to determine if the receiver(s) is/​are authorised to receive any possibly privacy sensitive information, like for example medical information that is reducible to a specific patient. Users are therefore responsible and liable for information they send to other users. Service Provider cannot be held responsible or liable for any privacy sensitive information sent through the Service by users without the required authorisation. Notwithstanding above, the service provider is not accomplished, skilled or analytical in its functionality to process any such information and is confined to the mechanical transmission of messages only.
